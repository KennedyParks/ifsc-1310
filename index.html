    <h3>SpaceX Revision and Reflection</h3>

    <p>For the first draft of the SpaceX Dragon project, I focused mainly on the design of the website itself and less about how I structured the HTML and CSS. The first thing I did was check out the SpaceX, Tesla,and  Blue Origin websites and think to myself, “Okay…how do I replicate that design while making it my own?” I cranked out a rough draft with most of the design features I wanted and sort of built the code around it. 
    <p>It was brought up to me that my HTML had a lot of divs and could be better structured, so for the second iteration, I wanted to address that.
    <p>Working on it the second time, I deleted all of the old HTML and CSS, and started fresh. I chose to focus first on organizing the HTML and CSS into sections before writing any code for the content. I divided the body of the HTML code into two big sections, header and main. Within the main section, I divided every part of each page into sections and gave them all specific section IDs. Before, I only used CSS classes as identifiers. 
    <p>Because I wanted each block of text to have an image next to it, I floated images to the right of each block. I’m pretty glad with how the effect turned out. I edited the images in Photoshop to give them transparent gradients and to optimize them for the web. This gave the pages a seamless flowy feel and kept the image file sizes low. I also added animations for the text which added a nice touch I think. 
    <p>The first time I made the SpaceX Dragon website, I didn’t utilize utility classes, but I did this time and it made my workflow faster. I didn’t make new CSS classes for different elements with the same attributes. 
    <p>My experience working on this project was great! It ultimately took a lot of work and a bit of unlearning, but I’m happy with how I progressed using HTML and CSS. It was a good exercise for me to focus on building the foundation of the website before hopping into the design in the way that I’m used to. I think this made me a bit of a better developer and I’m excited about working on more web projects.</p>

    <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>

<p>Progressive Enhancement is a technique used by web designers and developers to make the content and functionality of websites as accessible to all browsers and devices (including older ones) as possible. This is done by first building a foundation for the site by building it in a way that allows basic functioning for older browsers or devices that can’t support newer development updates. Then, after that’s achieved, stylistic and functional changes are added to make the site more complex and modern for newer browsers and devices that can support new languages. In short, the process goes from simple to complex.
<p>Progressive enhancement functionally runs opposite to another web building technique called Graceful Degradation. Graceful Degradation goes from complex to simple, meaning that building the website for newer browsers and devices like adding JavaScript and CSS comes first - or happens at the same time as building the foundation of the site, and the basic functionality of the website is more of an afterthought. This isn’t ideal because the functionality of the website is more likely to break when someone uses an older browser or device. <p>Progressive Enhancement prevents that from happening by covering all of those corners from the beginning. 
<p>Ultimately, the Progressive Enhancement technique creates a more accessible and equitable web experience for all users machines.
